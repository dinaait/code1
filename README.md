Voice-Controlled Web Search
This Python project uses speech recognition to listen to voice commands and perform web searches automatically using a browser. The program continuously listens for commands such as "search <query>" and opens the search results in a web browser. It also stops listening when the user says "stop".

Features
Voice Command Recognition: Detects spoken commands using the speech_recognition library.
Web Search Integration: Uses Selenium to open a browser and perform a Google search for the given query.
Stop Command: Stops the program when the user says "stop".
